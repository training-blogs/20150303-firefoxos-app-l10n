# TranslationTester

This is a simplified version of the TranslationTester, written by Robert Nyman: https://github.com/robnyman/TranslationTester.

This version is not localized, and is the version we start with in the MDN app localization tutorial and the accompanying screencast. If you want to play along with the tutorial, you can start with this version.
